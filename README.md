## Usage

### Hosted

Latest version (master) hosted on [Vercel](https://material-e621.vercel.app/).

### Local

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Serve the contents of `dist` on a http server. ([handy list](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255))

## Some goals

- rewrite everything using typescript, vue3 function api and vuetify 3; with more focus on performance (than the previous version)
- more customizability, re-add features removed during rewriting
- create a desktop application
